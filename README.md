# Bibmanagement

Quick overview
--------------
This is a small library in python, meant to manipulate programatically a bibliography, with emphasize on the output formatting.
The bibliography is read from a `.bib` file, with additional data on journal, conference or authors loaded from `.json` files. The ouput formatting can be specified by a string, and ouput to text, word or excel files are supported.

Some examples of use can be found in the 'scripts' folder, in particular in 'scripts/main.py'
