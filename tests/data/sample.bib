  abstract = {In this letter, we propose a whole-body control strategy for humanoid robots in multi-contact settings that enables switching between fixed and sliding contacts under active balance. We compute, in real-time, a safe center-of-mass position and wrench distribution of the contact points based on the Chebyshev center. Our solution is formulated as a quadratic programming problem without a priori computation of balance regions. We assess our approach with experiments highlighting switches between fixed and sliding contact modes in multi-contact configurations. A humanoid robot demonstrates such contact interchanges from fully-fixed to multi-sliding and also shuffling of the foot. The scenarios illustrate the performance of our control scheme in achieving the desired forces, CoM position attractor, and planned trajectories while actively maintaining balance.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses an efficient reaching motion planning method tailored for teleoperated humanoid robots in complex environments. This method offers low-level autonomy that allows the robot to autonomously plan and execute simple tasks, thus making teleoperation easy. Efficiency is achieved by combining the phases of planning and execution. The planning phase quickly decides on a reaching motion by approximating mass distribution which enables analytical solutions of inverse kinematics. The execution phase executes the planned path while compensating for the approximation error, as long as other constraints are maintained. Simulations confirm that (1) a reaching motion is planned in approximately one second for the HRP-2 humanoid robot with 30 degrees of freedom in a constrained environment with pipes and (2) the execution is done in real-time.},

The issue is to be approached in terms of the identification theory developed in the field of robotics. The under-actuated base-link which characterizes the dynamics of legged systems is the focus of this work. The useful mechanical feature to analyze the dynamics of legged system is proven: the set of inertial parameters appearing in the equation of motion of the under-actuated base is equivalent to the set in the equations of the whole body. In particular, when no external force acts on the system, all of the parameters in the set except the total mass are generally identifiable only from the observation of the free-flying motion. We also propose a method to identify the inertial parameters based on the dynamics of the under-actuated base. The method does not require the measurement of the joint torques. Neither the joint frictions nor the actuator dynamics need to be considered. Even when the system has no external reaction force, the method is still applicable. The method has been tested on both a humanoid robot and a human, and the experimental results are shown.},

  abstract = {Hierarchical least-square optimization is often used in robotics to inverse a direct function when multiple incompatible objectives are involved. Typical examples are inverse kinematics or dynamics. The objectives can be given as equalities to be satisfied (e.g. point-to-point task) or as areas of satisfaction (e.g. the joint range). This two-part paper proposes a complete solution to resolve multiple least-square quadratic problems of both equality and inequality constraints ordered into a strict hierarchy. Our method is able to solve a hierarchy of only equalities ten time faster than the classical method and can consider inequalities at any level while running at the typical control frequency on whole-body size problems. This generic solver is used to resolve the redundancy of humanoid robots while generating complex movements in constrained environment. In this first part, we establish the mathematical bases underlying the hierarchical problem and propose a dedicated solver. When only equalities are involved, the solver amounts to the classical solution used to handle redundancy in inverse kinematics in a far more efficient way. It is able to handle inequalities at any priority levels into a single resolution scheme, which avoids the high number of iterations encountered with cascades of solvers. A simple example is given to illustrate the interest of our approach. The second part of the paper focuses on the implementation of the solver for inverse kinematics and its use to generate robot motions.},

We, therefore, equipped the whole upper body of the humanoid HRP-2 with various patches of CellulARSkin – a modular artificial skin. In order to automatically handle a potentially high number of tactile sensor cells and motors units, the robot uses open-loop exploratio nmotions, and distributed accelerometers in the artificial skin cells, to acquire its self-centered sensory-motor knowledge. This body self-knowledge is then utilized to transfer multi-modal tactile stimulations into reactive body motions. Tactile events provide feedback on changes of contact on the whole-body surface.We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on a humanoid, here HRP-2, grasping large and unknown objects only via tactile feedback. Kinesthetically taught grasping trajectories, are reactively adapted tothe size and stiffness of different test objects. Our paper contributes the first realization of a self-organizing tactile sensor-behavior mapping on a full-sized humanoid robot, enabling a position controlled robot to compliantly handle objects.},

  abstract = {The question of how humans predict outcomes of observed motor actions by others is a fundamental problem in cognitive and social neuroscience. Previous theoretical studies have suggested that the brain uses parts of the forward model (used to estimate sensory outcomes of self-generated actions) to predict outcomes of observed actions. However, this hypothesis has remained controversial due to the lack of direct experimental evidence. To address this issue, we analyzed the behavior of darts experts in an understanding learning paradigm and utilized computational modeling to examine how outcome prediction of observed actions affected the participants’ ability to estimate their own actions. We recruited darts experts because sports experts are known to have an accurate outcome estimation of their own actions as well as prediction of actions observed in others. We first show that learning to predict the outcomes of observed dart throws deteriorates an expert’s abilities to both produce his own darts actions and estimate the outcome of his own throws (or self-estimation). Next, we introduce a state-space model to explain the trial-by-trial changes in the darts performance and self-estimation through our experiment. The model-based analysis reveals that the change in an expert’s self-estimation is explained only by considering a change in the individual’s forward model, showing that an improvement in an expert’s ability to predict outcomes of observed actions affects the individual’s forward model. These results suggest that parts of the same forward model are utilized in humans to both estimate outcomes of self-generated actions and predict outcomes of observed actions.},

The proposed framework can uniformly handle any arbitrary surface generated from point clouds, for autonomously planing the contact locations and interaction forces on potentially moving, movable, and deformable surfaces, which occur in direct physical human-robot interaction.

The surrounding environment can be unstructured and may contain cluttered obstacles. The post-impact stage uses a quadratic program controller that adapts on-line the joint proportional-derivative (PD) gains to make the robot compliant –to absorb impact and post-impact dynamics, which lowers possible damage risks. This is done by a new approach incorporating the stiffness and damping gains directly as decision variables in the QP along with the usually-considered variables of joint accelerations and contact forces. Constraints of the QP prevent the motors from reaching their torque limits during the fall. Several experiments on the humanoid robot HRP-4 in a full-dynamics simulator are presented and discussed.},

In this paper, we propose a method of constructing a perception based locomotion system for a humanoid robot. The major contribution of this paper is solving a problem of the locomotion error caused by the task constraints, by locally compensating footsteps and assessing the need for global footstep re-planning online based on environmental measurements. The proposed system provides an accurate and dense ground point cloud, called HeightField, using plane estimation and space interpolation, and obstacle point cloud for frequent collision avoidance by accumulating laser scans. This environmental perception enables a humanoid robot to plan footsteps globally even in the situation where the sight of the robot is limited and compensate footsteps while estimating landing state during locomotion online with the localization result. We evaluated the practicality of the proposed system by applying it to our humanoid robot carrying a heavy object in a construction site and confirmed that the proposed system contributed to improved locomotion abilities of a humanoid robot engaging in heavy-duty or dangerous tasks.},

In order to improve such devices, the quantitative evaluation about their effect on human will be indispensable. We aim to develop the method supporting the human-centered design and promote industry by making industrial standards about effect on humans. As a first step, this paper presents our work about the design support for robotic transfer aid by using digital human models and its dynamics analysis.},
